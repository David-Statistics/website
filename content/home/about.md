# About Me

I am currently a graduate student at Colorado State University in the Department of Statistics. My recent work has dealt with analog forecasting of snow water equivalent in mountainous regions. I am more broadly interested in Bayesian hierarchical modeling in applications with spatial and/or temporal dependence.
